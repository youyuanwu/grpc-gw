//! grpc-gw — a dynamic gRPC↔JSON transcoding reverse proxy.
//!
//! See `docs/design/grpc-gateway-design.md` for the architecture and
//! `docs/design/m1-scope.md` for the current (M1) build scope.
//!
//! At this early stage the crate exposes [`descriptor`] (the Spike 0 proof:
//! extracting `google.api.http` annotations from a runtime-loaded
//! `FileDescriptorSet` with no generated annotation types), [`routes`] (the
//! M1 route table lowered from those annotations plus synthesized defaults),
//! [`transcode`] (JSON ⇄ dynamic message), and [`status`] (gRPC code → HTTP
//! mapping and the error envelope).
